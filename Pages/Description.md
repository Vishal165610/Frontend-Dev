In this section of my journey, I am working on Login/Sign Up page designs while exploring and learning new UI/UX design techniques with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸ“‚ Pages Designed So Far

Page 01 : https://vishal165610.github.io/Frontend-Dev/Pages/Page%2001/
 â€“ First design attempt (basic structure).

Page 02 : https://vishal165610.github.io/Frontend-Dev/Pages/Page%2002/
 â€“ Improved design with styling experiments.

Page 03 : https://vishal165610.github.io/Frontend-Dev/Pages/Page%2003/
 â€“ Currently in progress (working on enhancements and new UI ideas).

âœ¨ This is just the beginning of my frontend development journey, and Iâ€™ll keep updating this repository with new pages, improved designs, and experiments as I grow.
