This project is a part of my frontend development learning journey, where I am exploring how to design and style navigation bars using only HTML and CSS.

ðŸ“‚ Navbar Designs

Navbar 01 : https://vishal165610.github.io/Frontend-Dev/Navbar/Navbar-01/
 â€“ Basic structure and layout.

Navbar 02 : https://vishal165610.github.io/Frontend-Dev/Navbar/Navbar-02/
 â€“ Styled with improved design elements.

Navbar 03 : https://vishal165610.github.io/Frontend-Dev/Navbar/Navbar-03/
 â€“ More polished design with better UI approach.

âœ… This phase of my Navbar learning ends here.
âœ¨ However, whenever I gain new ideas or learn more techniques, Iâ€™ll keep updating this repository with fresh designs and improvements.
